                       <p>This being is my first compiling project with reality of words I would like to thank ROW for giving me this opportunity and believing in me for the efforts I'd put in the project and if the project head wouldn't have come forward and approached me, I would have missed this chance to work with such a good publication. Thank you to all the team members, project head, founder & co-founder of the publication house and everyone who have worked with me, supporting me throughout the beautiful journey. We had equal faith on each other in this project and I love the way they spread positivity to everyone and they are really good at encouraging all the compilers, co-authors, etc., and motivating them to reach the target.

                    Even mine this is the first ever compilation and been given this opportunity by the row to be a compiler of the book.
                    Actually, I knew nothing about publishing and compilation, I was such a naive in even dealing with peoples but zinnia mam guided me along the journey from start to the end everything ...
                    
                    So, yeah! I must say row is such a supporting publishing house...
